"# BattleShip" 

This is a game called "Battle Ship". It could be also interpreted as a command-line-playing version of Hide & Seek.

The Game4play.py would require you to enter players' names and their desired hiding position to set up the game for playing.

If you have too many players queueing to play the game, you might use the Playerselection.py file.
The file Playerselection.py would randomly pick players from the names that you entered.

Have Fun!
